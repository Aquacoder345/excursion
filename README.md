The web page build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so I've use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. 
In this project, I created a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” 
I used my growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub.
A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
